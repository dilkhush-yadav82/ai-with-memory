These attributes are: \n1. \"KD\" (Kill-Death Ratio) of 7.1\n2. \"EQ\" (Endurance Quotient) of 60\n3. \"AI\" (Artificial Intelligence Level) - Rahul uses AI-powered characters in his team and they have an average score of 80 on a scale of 0 to 100. \n\nOne day, after discussing strategies with his friend, he was informed about some secret attributes associated with top players' scores. These are: \n\n1. Top Players have a KD ratio that is either 5 points more or less than Rahul's.\n2. Top Players' EQ is always 3 times higher than Rahul's.\n3. Top Players use AI-powered characters with an average score of 90 on a scale of 0 to 100.\n\nIf these attributes are true, can you determine what the KD, EQ and AI level are for the top players?\n\n\nThe first thing we know is that the KD ratio of the top players is 5 points more or less than Rahul's. That means it could be 7.6 (7.1 + 5) or 2.6 (7.1 - 5). \n\nKnowing that the top players' EQ is 3 times higher than Rahul's, we can calculate this as 60 * 3 = 180.\n\nThe AI level of the top players should be 90 which is higher than Rahul's 80.\n\nUsing inductive logic, we can infer from the given facts and the results from steps 2 and 3 that: Top Players' KD could be either 7.6 or 2.6, their EQ is 180 and their AI level is 90.\n\nAnswer: Top players have a KD of either 7.6 or 2.6, an EQ of 180 and an AI level of 90. \n"
